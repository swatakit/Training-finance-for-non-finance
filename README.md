# VBA for Data Wrangling

This repository is a collection teaching material that I used to provide to undergrate/grads students. It also contains simple financial calculation in excel, and how to complete it in VBA.

As for the part of financial calculation,
I highly recommend "Modern Portfolio Theory and Investment Analysis" by Elton et al.
